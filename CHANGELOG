orcus 0.19.2

* general

  * fixed a build issue with gcc 14 due to a missing include for std::find_if
    and std::for_each.

  * fixed a segmentation fault with the orcus-test-xml-mapped test which
    manifested on hppa hardware, as originally reported on
    https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1054376.

* xls-xml

  * fixed a crash when loading a document that includes a style record
    referencing an unnamed style record as its parent.  In Excel-generated
    documents, styles only reference named styles as their parents.  But in
    3rd-party generated documents, styles referencing unnamed styles as their
    parents can occur.

* gnumeric

  * fixed a crash when the document model returned a null pointer when a
    reference resolver interface was requested.

orcus 0.19.1

* general

  * implemented orcus::create_filter() which instantiates a filter object of
    specified type.  The returned object is of type
    orcus::iface::import_filter.

  * moved test cases for format detection to the respective filter test files.

* gnumeric

  * fixed a bug where the import filter did not set the formula grammer prior
    to importing.

orcus 0.19.0

* general

  * added support for allowing use of std::filesystem,
    std::experimental::filesystem or boost::filesystem per build
    configuration.

* xlsx

  * refactored styles import to use style indices returned by the document
    model implementer rather than using the indices stored in the file.  This
    allows the implementer to aggregate some style records and re-use the same
    index for records that are stored as different records in the original
    file.

* xls-xml

  * fixed a bug where column styles were not applied to the correct columns
    when the starting column index was not 0.

* gnumeric

  * overhauled the Gnumeric import filter to fix many bugs and support many
    missing features relative to the other filters included in orcus.  Most
    notable mentions are:

    * cell styles

    * rich-text strings

    * named ranges

    * row heights and column widths

    * merged cells

* parquet

  * added partial support for Apache Parquet import filter.  This is still
    heavily experimental.

orcus 0.18.1

* sax parser

  * added support for optionally skipping multiple BOM's in the beginning of
    XML stream.  This affects all XML-based file format filters such as
    xls-xml (aka Excel 2003 XML).

* xml-map

  * fixed a bug where XML documents consisting of simple single-column records
    were not properly converted to sheet data.

* xls-xml

  * fixed a bug where the filter would always pass border color even when it
    was not set.

* buildsystem

  * added new configure switches --without-benchmark and --without-doc-example
    to optinally skip building of these two directories.

orcus 0.18.0

* general

  * fixed the flat output mode to properly calculate the lengths of UTF-8
    encoded strings.

  * replaced all uses of std::strtol() to parse_integer() to properly parse
    strings that are not necessarily null-terminated.

  * added a new output format type 'debug-state' which dumps the internal
    state of the populated document model in detail.  This can be useful
    during debugging.

  * separated the import_shared_string interface implementation from the
    backend shared strings store per separation of responsibility.

  * merged the foo_t and foo_active_t struct pair, such as font_t and
    font_active_t, in the styles store into a single type using std::optional.

  * revised the documentation and public API and cleaned things up where
    necessary.

* ods

  * reimplemented the number format styles import to correctly keep track of
    element stacks and correctly perform structure checks to detect malformed
    documents.

  * added new interface to import named styles applied to columns.

  * added new interface to import attributes for asian and complex scripts for
    the folloiwng font attributes:

    * font name

    * font size

    * font style

    * font weight

  * re-designed the styles import interface to make it multi-level.

  * re-worked the import of the style:text-underline-width attribute to make
    its handling more in line with the specifications.

* xls-xml

  * added support for importing wrap-text and shrink-to-fit cell format
    attributes.

  * added support for importing cell-hidden and locked attributes.

  * added support for importing direct and named cell formats applied to
    columns and rows.

* xlsx

  * added support for importing wrap-text and shrink-to-fit cell format
    attributes.

  * added support for importing direct and named cell formats applied to
    columns and rows.

* xml-map

  * added a new interface to pass the encoding information to the document
    model so that it can correctly decode non-UTF-8-encoded string values.

orcus 0.17.2

* ods

  * fixed a bug where the state of style:cell-protect="none" was not
    explicitly pushed, thereby having had the same effect as not having this
    attribute.  After the fix, style:cell-protect="none" will explicitly push
    the hidden state to false, locked state to false, and the formula-hidden
    state to false.

orcus 0.17.1

* general

  * addressed a number of coverity issues.

  * removed a variety of compiler warnings.

* ods

  * re-generated sax parser tokens from ODF v1.3.

  * revised the style import code to only push style attributes that are
    actually specified in the XML.

* xls-xml

  * revised the XML structure validation strategy to ignore any mis-placed
    elements and their sub structures rather than aborting the import.

orcus 0.17.0

* general

  * set the baseline C++ version to 17.

  * cleaned up the public API to replace pstring with std::string_view, union
    with std::variant, and boost::optional with std::optional.  With this
    change, the public API no longer has dependency on boost.

* spreadsheet document

  * switched to using ixion::model_iterator for horizontal iteration of cells
    instead of using mdds::mtv::collection.

  * fixed a bug where exporting a spreadsheet document containing adjacent
    merged cells regions to html incorrectly exported the merged cell areas.

* xlsx

  * cached cell values are now correctly loaded from the file.

* sax parser

  * utf-8 names are now allowed as element and attribute names.

* css parser

  * unquoted utf-8 property values are now allowed.

* orcus-json

  * fixed segmentation fault when using --mode structure with the Windows
    build.

  * added yaml output option.

* xml-map

  * fixed a bug where mapping of an XML document with namespace aliases
    sometimes corrupts the alias values.

* python

  * added orcus.FormulaTokenOp enum type which describes type formula token
    operator types in a more finer grained manner.

* documentation

  * added notes to how to use orcus-xml and orcus-json to map XML and JSON
    documents to spreadsheet documents.

orcus 0.16.1

* fixed a build issue on 32-bit linux platforms, which was indirectly caused
  by ixion.

* fixed json parsing bug caused by an uninitialized variable, which manifested
  itself on debian 32-bit platform.

* removed compiler warnings on unused variables from the base parser handlers.

orcus 0.16.0

* general

  * full formula recalculations are now optional when loading documents.  It
    makes more effective use of cached formula results.

  * added the option of failing on the first faulty cell, or skipping them.

  * fixed a bug that caused the threaded_sax_token_parser to deadlock.

  * added base parser handler classes in the public headers so that they can
    be sub-classed to overwrite necessary handler methods.

* json-parser

  * parsing of numeric values are now more strict for better conformance to
    the specs.

* ods

  * added support for loading named expressions from ods documents.

  * fixed a segfault when loading the xlsx document from
    https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=83711.

* xls-xml

  * fixed a bug that prevented formulas from referencing cells located in
    later sheets.

* xml-map

  * adjusted the xml path expressions to be more like XPath.  Previously, an
    attribute was expressed as '@' in the old expression, but XPath uses '/@'.
    The new expression uses '/@' for an attribute.

  * added the ability to identify and import ranges from XML documents without
    map file.

  * added the ability to generate map file from XML documents for user
    customization.

  * added support to specify default namespace in the map file.

* python

  * added orcus.Cell class to represent individual cell values and attributes.

  * fixed several memory leaks in the python binding layer.

  * modified orcus.csv.read() function to take string input, instead of bytes.

  * added __version__ attribute to the orcus module.

  * cleaned up orcus.detect_format function to only take the stream parameter.

  * added named_expressions properties to Document and Sheet class objects.

  * added Python API to bulk-process a number of spreadsheet documents
    (orcus.tools.file_processor).

  * added Python API to download attachments from bugzilla services via REST
    API (orcus.tools.bugzilla).

orcus 0.15.4

* fixed a build error with gcc 10 with LTO.  For more details, visit
  (https://bugs.gentoo.org/715154).

* removed potentially non-free specification and schema files from the
  package.

orcus 0.15.3

* xml-map

  * fixed another bug related to filling of cells down the column in a linked
    range with nested repeat elements.  The bug would occur when the field in
    a linked range is more than one level deeper than the nearest row group
    element.

* xls-xml

  * fixed a bug where TopCell and LeftCell attributes of the Table element
    were not properly honored.

orcus 0.15.2

* xml-map

  * fixed a bug that prevented filling of cells down the column in a linked
    range with nested repeat elements.  The bug would occur when the field in
    a linked range is associated with an element content rather than an
    attribute.

* xls-xml

  * added code to properly pick up and pass the number format codes, including
    named number format values such as 'General Date', 'Long Time, 'Currency'
    etc.

* fixed a build issue on older macOS environment, related to passing an rvalue
  to a tuple expecting a const reference.  The root cause was a bug in libc++
  of LLVM < 7.

* fixed a build issue with gcc5.

orcus 0.15.1

* switched xml_map_tree to using boost::object_pool to manage the life
  cycles of the objects within xml_map_tree, to avoid memory
  fragmentation.

* fixed incorrect handling of newly created elements in xml_map_tree.

* fixed segfault caused by double deletion of allocated memory for
  xml_map_tree::element, which seemed to happen only on 32-bit gcc builds.

* fixed weird test failures related to equality check of two double-precision
  values, caused probably by aggressive compiler optimization which only seems
  to get triggered in 32-bit gcc builds.

orcus 0.15.0

* spreadsheet interface

  * import_sheet::fill_down_cells() has been added as a required method, to
    allow the import filter code to duplicate cell value downward in one step.

* json parser

  * added test cases from JSONTestSuite.

  * fixed a bug on parsing an empty array containing one or more blank
    characters between the brackets.

* sax parser

  * fixed a bug on parsing an attribute value with encoded character
    immediately followed by a ';', such as '&amp;;'.

  * fixed a bug on parsing an assignment character '=' that either preceded or
    followed by whitespaces in attribute definition.

  * optionally use SSE4.2 intrinsics to speed up element name parsing.

* orcus-xml

  * revised its cli interface to make use of boost's program_options.

  * orcus-xml-dump's functionality has been combined into orcus-xml.

  * map mode now supports nested repeat elements to be mapped as range fields.

* orcus-json

  * map mode has been added to allow mapping of JSON documents to spreadsheet
    document model.  This mode either takes explicit mapping rule via map
    file, or performs automatic mapping by auto-identifying mappable ranges by
    analyzing the structure of the JSON document.

  * structure mode has been added to display the logical structures of JSON
    documents.

  * significantly improved performance of json document tree by utilizing
    object pool to manage the life cycles of json value instances.

* xls-xml

  * added support for importing named color values in the ss:Color attributes.

  * added support for handling UTF-16 streams that contains byte order marks.

* spreadsheet document

  * significantly improved performance of flat format output generation.

    strings.

  * file_content class has been added to memory-map file contents instead of
    loading them in-memory.

  * memory_content class has been added to map in-memory buffer with the
    optional ability to perform unicode conversion.

  * dom_tree has been renamed to dom::document_tree, and its interface has
    been cleaned up to hide its implementation details.

orcus 0.14.1

* addressed a number of coverity issues.

* improved precision of points-to-twips measurement conversions by
  reducing the number of numeric operations to be performed.  This
  especially helps on i386 platforms.

orcus 0.14.0

* spreadsheet interface

  * import_data_table::set_range() now receives a parameter of type
    range_t.

  * import_sheet::set_array_formula() interface methods have been
    removed and replaced with import_sheet::get_array_formula() that
    returns an interface of type import_array_formula.

  * import_formula interface class has been added to replace the
    formula related methods of import_sheet.  As a result,
    set_formula(), set_shared_formula(), and set_formula_result()
    methods have been removed from the import_sheet interface class.

  * import_auto_filter::set_range() now receives a parameter of type
    range_t, rather than a string value representing a range.

  * import_sheet::set_fill_pattern_type() interface method now takes
    an enum value of type fill_pattern_t, rather than a string value.

* xls-xml

  * pick up the character set from the XML declaration, and pass it
    to the client app via import_global_settings interface.

  * support importing of array formulas.

* xlsx

  * support importing of array formulas.

  * fixed a bug where sheet indices being passed to the append_sheet()
    interface method were incorrect.

* shared formula handling code has been re-worked.

* spreadsheet::sheet class has been de-coupled from the import and
  export interfaces.

* previously known as import_styles class is now split into styles
  class and import_styles factory wrapper class.

* sax_parser now gracefully ignores leading whitespace(s) if any,
  rather than aborting the parsing for it's not a valid XML stream
  to have leading whitespace(s).  In the future we should make this
  behavior configurable.

* python

  * add orcus.xlsx.read() function that takes a file object to load
    an xlsx file as a replacement for orcus.xlsx.read_file().

  * add orcus.ods.read(), orcus.xls_xml.read(), orcus.csv.read(),
    and orcus.gnumeric.read() functions.

  * add orcus.Sheet.write() method which exports sheet content to
    specified format.  For now only the csv format type is
    supported.

* xml_map_tree no longer requires the source stream persisted in
  memory between the read and write.

* the sax parser now stores the offset positions of each element
  rather than their memory positions, in order to make the position
  values usable between duplicated stream instances.

* xml_structure_tree to support selection of an element by element
  path.

* document

  * correctly set the argument separator depending on the formula
    grammar type.  This change fixes loading of ods documents with
    formula cells.

  * fix incorrect handling of formula cells without result caches.

* fix incorrect parsing of invalid XML documents with multiple
  self-closing root elements.

orcus 0.13.3
