    elements and their sub structures rather than aborting the import.

orcus 0.17.0

* general

  * set the baseline C++ version to 17.

  * cleaned up the public API to replace pstring with std::string_view, union
    with std::variant, and boost::optional with std::optional.  With this
    change, the public API no longer has dependency on boost.

* spreadsheet document

  * switched to using ixion::model_iterator for horizontal iteration of cells
    instead of using mdds::mtv::collection.

  * fixed a bug where exporting a spreadsheet document containing adjacent
    merged cells regions to html incorrectly exported the merged cell areas.

* xlsx

  * cached cell values are now correctly loaded from the file.

* sax parser

  itself on debian 32-bit platform.

* removed compiler warnings on unused variables from the base parser handlers.

orcus 0.16.0

    (orcus.tools.file_processor).

  * added Python API to download attachments from bugzilla services via REST
    API (orcus.tools.bugzilla).

orcus 0.15.4

* removed potentially non-free specification and schema files from the
  package.

orcus 0.15.3

* xml-map

  * fixed another bug related to filling of cells down the column in a linked
    range with nested repeat elements.  The bug would occur when the field in
    a linked range is more than one level deeper than the nearest row group
    element.

* xls-xml

  * fixed a bug where TopCell and LeftCell attributes of the Table element
    were not properly honored.

orcus 0.15.2

* xml-map

    range with nested repeat elements.  The bug would occur when the field in
    a linked range is associated with an element content rather than an
    attribute.

* xls-xml

  * added code to properly pick up and pass the number format codes, including
    named number format values such as 'General Date', 'Long Time, 'Currency'
    etc.

* fixed a build issue on older macOS environment, related to passing an rvalue
  to a tuple expecting a const reference.  The root cause was a bug in libc++
  of LLVM < 7.

* fixed a build issue with gcc5.

orcus 0.15.1

* switched xml_map_tree to using boost::object_pool to manage the life
  cycles of the objects within xml_map_tree, to avoid memory
  fragmentation.

* fixed incorrect handling of newly created elements in xml_map_tree.

* fixed segfault caused by double deletion of allocated memory for
  xml_map_tree::element, which seemed to happen only on 32-bit gcc builds.

* fixed weird test failures related to equality check of two double-precision
  values, caused probably by aggressive compiler optimization which only seems
  to get triggered in 32-bit gcc builds.

orcus 0.15.0

  * added test cases from JSONTestSuite.

  * fixed a bug on parsing an empty array containing one or more blank
    characters between the brackets.

* sax parser

  * fixed a bug on parsing an attribute value with encoded character
    immediately followed by a ';', such as '&amp;;'.

  * fixed a bug on parsing an assignment character '=' that either preceded or
    followed by whitespaces in attribute definition.

  * optionally use SSE4.2 intrinsics to speed up element name parsing.

* orcus-xml

  * revised its cli interface to make use of boost's program_options.

  * orcus-xml-dump's functionality has been combined into orcus-xml.

  * map mode now supports nested repeat elements to be mapped as range fields.

* orcus-json

  * map mode has been added to allow mapping of JSON documents to spreadsheet
    document model.  This mode either takes explicit mapping rule via map
    file, or performs automatic mapping by auto-identifying mappable ranges by
    analyzing the structure of the JSON document.

  * structure mode has been added to display the logical structures of JSON
    documents.

  * significantly improved performance of json document tree by utilizing
    object pool to manage the life cycles of json value instances.

* xls-xml

  * added support for importing named color values in the ss:Color attributes.

  * added support for handling UTF-16 streams that contains byte order marks.

* spreadsheet document

  * significantly improved performance of flat format output generation.

    strings.

  * file_content class has been added to memory-map file contents instead of
    loading them in-memory.

  * memory_content class has been added to map in-memory buffer with the
    optional ability to perform unicode conversion.

  * dom_tree has been renamed to dom::document_tree, and its interface has
    been cleaned up to hide its implementation details.

orcus 0.14.1

* addressed a number of coverity issues.

* improved precision of points-to-twips measurement conversions by
  reducing the number of numeric operations to be performed.  This
  especially helps on i386 platforms.

orcus 0.14.0

* spreadsheet interface

  * import_data_table::set_range() now receives a parameter of type
    range_t.

  * import_sheet::set_array_formula() interface methods have been
    removed and replaced with import_sheet::get_array_formula() that
    returns an interface of type import_array_formula.

  * import_formula interface class has been added to replace the
    formula related methods of import_sheet.  As a result,
    set_formula(), set_shared_formula(), and set_formula_result()
    methods have been removed from the import_sheet interface class.

  * import_auto_filter::set_range() now receives a parameter of type
    range_t, rather than a string value representing a range.

  * import_sheet::set_fill_pattern_type() interface method now takes
    an enum value of type fill_pattern_t, rather than a string value.

* xls-xml

  * pick up the character set from the XML declaration, and pass it
    to the client app via import_global_settings interface.

  * support importing of array formulas.

* xlsx

  * support importing of array formulas.

  * fixed a bug where sheet indices being passed to the append_sheet()
    interface method were incorrect.

* shared formula handling code has been re-worked.

* spreadsheet::sheet class has been de-coupled from the import and
  export interfaces.

* previously known as import_styles class is now split into styles
  class and import_styles factory wrapper class.

* sax_parser now gracefully ignores leading whitespace(s) if any,
  rather than aborting the parsing for it's not a valid XML stream
  to have leading whitespace(s).  In the future we should make this
  behavior configurable.

* python

  * add orcus.xlsx.read() function that takes a file object to load
    an xlsx file as a replacement for orcus.xlsx.read_file().

  * add orcus.ods.read(), orcus.xls_xml.read(), orcus.csv.read(),
    and orcus.gnumeric.read() functions.

  * add orcus.Sheet.write() method which exports sheet content to
    specified format.  For now only the csv format type is
    supported.

* xml_map_tree no longer requires the source stream persisted in
  memory between the read and write.

* the sax parser now stores the offset positions of each element
  rather than their memory positions, in order to make the position
  values usable between duplicated stream instances.

* xml_structure_tree to support selection of an element by element
  path.

* document

  * correctly set the argument separator depending on the formula
    grammar type.  This change fixes loading of ods documents with
    formula cells.
